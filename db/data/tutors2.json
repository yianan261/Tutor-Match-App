I highly recommend him.","Tutor is by far the best tutor I’ve ever worked with! From our very first lesson, I felt like my idea for the project was heard and received. Not once did she try to stir my idea in a direction she felt was right—she allowed me to bring forth all my ideas. Luckily, the ideas she did have were those we both conjured up. Our meeting times were flexible and she always offered to meet at another time if we logged on and I appeared to be busy. Tutor worked outside of our meeting times to ensure certain parts of the project were complete, if we couldn’t work on them during the time frame. Thanks to her, working on this project was truly about the experience and it didn’t feel like I was doing tedious work. She brought forth my knowledge and showcased how things I had learned previously could be applied to creating a specific element of the project!

Our meeting times were flexible and she always offered to meet at another time if we logged on and I appeared to be busy.

Not once did she try to stir my idea in a direction she felt was right—she allowed me to bring forth all my ideas. Luckily, the ideas she did have were those we both conjured up. Our meeting times were flexible and she always offered to meet at another time if we logged on and I appeared to be busy. Tutor worked outside of our meeting times to ensure certain parts of the project were complete, if we couldn’t work on them during the time frame. Thanks to her, working on this project was truly about the experience and it didn’t feel like I was doing tedious work. She brought forth my knowledge and showcased how things I had learned previously could be applied to creating a specific element of the project! Thanks Tutor for your time, patience, and understanding <3","Tutor was understanding as I had to reschedule our regularly scheduled session not once, but TWICE. She didn’t get annoyed nor did that change her attitude in our session.

Not once did she try to stir my idea in a direction she felt was right—she allowed me to bring forth all my ideas. Luckily, the ideas she did have were those we both conjured up. Our meeting times were flexible and she always offered to meet at another time if we logged on and I appeared to be busy. Tutor worked outside of our meeting times to ensure certain parts of the project were complete, if we couldn’t work on them during the time frame. Thanks to her, working on this project was truly about the experience and it didn’t feel like I was doing tedious work. She brought forth my knowledge and showcased how things I had learned previously could be applied to creating a specific element of the project!
